An Android game that prompts the user to keep clicking buttons until all the buttons on the screen become green and the game gets over.
The lesser the time taken to do this,the higher the scoreof the player.
But each time a button is clicked,the color of 2 or more other buttons change.
Hence,giving the player a sense of randomness while playing.
